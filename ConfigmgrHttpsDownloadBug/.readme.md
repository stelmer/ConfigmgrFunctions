## Configmgr HTTPS Download Bug Fix

As discussed on the [Reddit SCCM community](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCCM/comments/qdduo6/package_failing_to_download_over_https_during/) there is a bug in Configmgr 2107 which can cause the task sequence engine to fall back to http when using https enabled distribution points.  This can lead to increased content download times as the client will exhaust all https locations first.


The included functions can be used to get and set the IIS SSL client certificate settings to remediate the issue.
